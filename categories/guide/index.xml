      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, three different distribution independent package formats have gained a lot of popularity. There are already a few Linux distributions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://verummeum.com/endless-os-review-2018/&#34;&gt;Endless OS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/&#34;&gt;Fedora Silverblue&lt;/a&gt; that depend solely on distribution independent packages to run desktop applications. Are these package formats ready to become main packages formats for Linux distributions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each package format individually, and of distribution independent package formats in general.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have a usable Android device without Google services or apps installed? Are there open-source, or at least more privacy friendly, alternatives to the Google apps and services most Android users depend on? I have been experimenting with my Android smartphone to find an answer to these questions. With this article I want to share how I have tried to achieve a Google free Android phone and what other options are available or will be available to you in the near future to also obtain a Google free Android device.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Search, comments and an image viewer with Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://verummeum.com/how-verummeum-is-build/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about why I chose Hugo, a static site generator, as the framework on which to build Verummeum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to go more in depth on the more advanced features I was able to integrate into Verummeum using Hugo. I hope this guide will be interesting for anyone who would like to know about the possibilities of static site generators in general, and of Hugo specifically. I myself underestimated the capabilities of static site generators until recently when I started doing some research, and I am happy to share what I have learned in this article.

      <title>How Verummeum is built, Hugo static site generator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I started building Verummeum I compared a number of different frameworks and content management systems.
After researching the advantages and disadvantages of the different choices available, I finally decided to create Verummeum using Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I made the choice to use Hugo I first decided that I wanted to create Verummeum as a static website. A static website has a number of advantages compared to a dynamic website.&lt;/p&gt;
