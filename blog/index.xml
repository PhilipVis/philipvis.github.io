      <title>Google free Android</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have a usable Android device without Google services or apps installed? Are there open-source, or at least more privacy friendly, alternatives to the Google apps and services most Android users depend on? I have been experimenting with my Android smartphone to find an answer to these questions. With this article I want to share how I have tried to achieve a Google free Android phone and what other options are available or will be available to you in the near future to also obtain a Google free Android device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our smartphones contain and record a lot of personal information like our location, contacts, conversations and possibly much more depending on your usage. It is no secret that most Android phones send some of this information to Google on a regular basis. A lot of the applications we install from the Google Play Store also require an insane amount of permissions that they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really need to function. These are my main reasons for investigating the possibility of running Android without Google services. I like to think of Android as an open system, on which we have the option to run anything we like. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if that&amp;rsquo;s true!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Siduction 2018.3 Cinnamon Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week I tried to test &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.siduction.org/&#34;&gt;Siduction&lt;/a&gt; 2018.3, with the Cinnamon desktop environment. Siduction is a rolling-release Linux distribution based on Debian unstable, also known as Debian sid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siduction is available with many different desktop environments, namely KDE, LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, Lxde, Xorg and noX. I chose to test the Cinnamon desktop because I have only used Cinnamon in combination with Linux Mint before, on which it ran very well, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to see how it performs on another Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Search, comments and an image viewer with Hugo</title>
      <link>https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/09/16/hugo-advanced-features/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/09/02/how-verummeum-is-build/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about why I chose Hugo, a static site generator, as the framework on which to build Verummeum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to go more in depth on the more advanced features I was able to integrate into Verummeum using Hugo. I hope this guide will be interesting for anyone who would like to know about the possibilities of static site generators in general, and of Hugo specifically. I myself underestimated the capabilities of static site generators until recently when I started doing some research, and I am happy to share what I have learned in this article.

This distribution aims to deliver the best user experience by providing an aesthetically pleasing and immersive desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest release of Voyager Live is based on the 18.04 Bionic Beaver long term support release of Xubuntu which is supported for 3 years. This is the version we will take a look at in this article.

      <title>How Verummeum is built, Hugo static site generator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I started building Verummeum I compared a number of different frameworks and content management systems.
After researching the advantages and disadvantages of the different choices available, I finally decided to create Verummeum using Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I made the choice to use Hugo I first decided that I wanted to create Verummeum as a static website. A static website has a number of advantages compared to a dynamic website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/08/25/pclinuxos-review-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pclinuxos.com/&#34;&gt;PCLinuxOS&lt;/a&gt; is a rolling release Linux distribution, offering a KDE and a MATE desktop version. Besides these official versions, other community maintained flavors for other desktop environments are available. This review is based on the KDE version of PCLinuxOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution is based on Mandriva Linux and uses RPM packages. It is a rolling release distribution that favors stability over providing bleeding edge software.
