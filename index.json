Are there open-source, or at least more privacy friendly, alternatives to the Google apps and services most Android users depend on? I have been experimenting with my Android smartphone to find an answer to these questions. With this article I want to share how I have tried to achieve a Google free Android phone and what other options are available or will be available to you in the near future to also obtain a Google free Android device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur smartphones contain and record a lot of personal information like our location, contacts, conversations and possibly much more depending on your usage. It is no secret that most Android phones send some of this information to Google on a regular basis. A lot of the applications we install from the Google Play Store also require an insane amount of permissions that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t really need to function. These are my main reasons for investigating the possibility of running Android without Google services. I like to think of Android as an open system, on which we have the option to run anything we like. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if that\u0026rsquo;s true!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Google","Android","guide","privacy","security"],"title":"Google free Android","uri":"https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/09/30/google-free-android/"},{"banner":"img/blog/2018/siduction/siduction-logo_thumbnail.jpg","date":"2018-09-20T15:28:00+02:00","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe past week I tried to test \u003ca href=\"https://news.siduction.org/\"\u003eSiduction\u003c/a\u003e 2018.3, with the Cinnamon desktop environment.
