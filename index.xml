      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, three different distribution independent package formats have gained a lot of popularity. There are already a few Linux distributions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://endlessos.com/home/&#34;&gt;Endless OS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/&#34;&gt;Fedora Silverblue&lt;/a&gt; that depend solely on distribution independent packages to run desktop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each package format individually, and of distribution independent package formats in general.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KDE Neon review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://neon.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE Neon&lt;/a&gt; recently released a new version of their Linux distribution, which I have been testing for the past week. I would like to share my experience with you in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution is based on Ubuntu 18.04 &amp;ldquo;Bionic Beaver&amp;rdquo;, the latest long-term support &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubuntu.com/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; release. What makes KDE Neon an interesting and unique project is that they provide a rolling release of the KDE Plasma desktop environment on top of the stable Ubuntu LTS base. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out if this mix of a stable base with a rolling KDE environment is a winning combination!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google free Android</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to have a usable Android device without Google services or apps installed? Are there open-source, or at least more privacy friendly, alternatives to the Google apps and services most Android users depend on? I have been experimenting with my Android smartphone to find an answer to these questions. With this article I want to share how I have tried to achieve a Google free Android phone and what other options are available or will be available to you in the near future to also obtain a Google free Android device.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Siduction 2018.3 Cinnamon Review</title>
      <link>https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/09/20/siduction-review-2018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week I tried to test &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.siduction.org/&#34;&gt;Siduction&lt;/a&gt; 2018.3, with the Cinnamon desktop environment. Siduction is a rolling-release Linux distribution based on Debian unstable, also known as Debian sid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siduction is available with many different desktop environments, namely KDE, LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, Lxde, Xorg and noX. I chose to test the Cinnamon desktop because I have only used Cinnamon in combination with Linux Mint before, on which it ran very well, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to see how it performs on another Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Search, comments and an image viewer with Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/09/02/how-verummeum-is-build/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about why I chose Hugo, a static site generator, as the framework on which to build Verummeum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to go more in depth on the more advanced features I was able to integrate into Verummeum using Hugo. I hope this guide will be interesting for anyone who would like to know about the possibilities of static site generators in general, and of Hugo specifically. I myself underestimated the capabilities of static site generators until recently when I started doing some research, and I am happy to share what I have learned in this article.

This distribution aims to deliver the best user experience by providing an aesthetically pleasing and immersive desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest release of Voyager Live is based on the 18.04 Bionic Beaver long term support release of Xubuntu which is supported for 3 years. This is the version we will take a look at in this article.

      <title>How Verummeum is built, Hugo static site generator</title>
      <link>https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/09/02/how-verummeum-is-build/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I started building Verummeum I compared a number of different frameworks and content management systems.
After researching the advantages and disadvantages of the different choices available, I finally decided to create Verummeum using Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I made the choice to use Hugo I first decided that I wanted to create Verummeum as a static website. A static website has a number of advantages compared to a dynamic website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PCLinuxOS KDE Review</title>
      <link>https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/08/25/pclinuxos-review-2018/</link>

      <guid>https://verummeum.com/blog/2018/08/25/pclinuxos-review-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pclinuxos.com/&#34;&gt;PCLinuxOS&lt;/a&gt; is a rolling release Linux distribution, offering a KDE and a MATE desktop version. Besides these official versions, other community maintained flavors for other desktop environments are available. This review is based on the KDE version of PCLinuxOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution is based on Mandriva Linux and uses RPM packages. It is a rolling release distribution that favors stability over providing bleeding edge software.
